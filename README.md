# Predicting Chicago Housing Prices to teach Linear and Logistic Modeling

This repository houses the data and jupyter notebooks associated with a revision to Data Science pedagogy at UC Berkeley. Taking Cook County, IL housing sales data, we ask students to predict housing prices on a test data set using both linear and logistic regression models. As part of this process, we also include critical lines of questioning that consider the nature of the given data and associate current housing data with the history of redlining in Chicago, IL.

This project is intended to change Homework 5 and 6 in UC Berkeley's intermediate Data Science course, Data Science 100.
